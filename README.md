# Planning
## Design Goal
Typewriters were a huge impact because they allowed people to write documents much faster and more quicker than handwriting. This made it easier to produce multiple copies of the same document and improved efficiency in offices. Typewriters played a key role in the rise of professional typing jobs, which contributed to social changes in the workforce. We got our idea from the type writte where ours basically uses the arm and click on one of the keys on the keyboard.
## Scope
Like I said the point of my project is that it will use an arm and it will click on the keyboard and create a sentence saying ( Hey how are you). Ands if we have more time I'll try and make it do it quicker/faster.
## Schedule
Week 1 - plan on how the design will look

week 3 - keep working
Week 4 - keep working and check for any issues we need to solve
week 5 - start printing 
week 6 - assemble it and see if it all works
