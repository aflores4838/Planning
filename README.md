# Planning
## Design Goal
Typewriters were a huge impact because they allowed people to write documents much faster and more quicker than handwriting. This made it easier to produce multiple copies of the same document and improved efficiency in offices. Typewriters played a key role in the rise of professional typing jobs, which contributed to social changes in the workforce. We got our idea from the type writte where ours basically uses the arm and click on one of the keys on the keyboard.
## Scope
Like I said the point of my project is that it will use an arm and it will click on the keyboard and create a sentence saying ( Hey how are you). Ands if we have more time I'll try and make it do it quicker/faster.
## Schedule
Week 1 - plan on how the design will look
week 2 - start on onshape and teamate workd on code
week 3 - keep working
Week 4 - keep working and check for any issues we need to solve
week 5 - start printing 
week 6 - assemble it and see if it all works 
week 7 - complete documentation 
week 8 - work on documentation
week 9 - finish and re look everything

## Add on 
This project is just another wierd version of a regular type writter. 
We will need 2 servos, lots of wires, 8 brackets to keep the box together, 14 screws and heads, and one metro board. How this will work is one servo will move 360 so the arm can move left and right and servo 2 will move the arm up and adown and will click on the key to create the sentence.
## Our other idea

This was one of our ideas we had in the beginning but then we saw we there were some part we didn't really need and it was over complicated and we didn't need all that for our project so we went with something more simmpler that would get the job done.
